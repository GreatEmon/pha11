                <p>"Poverty is not an inherent condition; it is a failure of the systems we have built. Every human being has the potential to rise beyond their circumstances, but they need opportunities, not handouts. By fostering social businesses, empowering individuals, and innovating systems that prioritize human dignity, we can eradicate poverty, ensure sustainability, and build a world where every person can thrive with purpose and independence. The future we want is within our grasp if we work together to create it."</p>
